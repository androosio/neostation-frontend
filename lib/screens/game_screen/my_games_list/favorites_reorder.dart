  /// loaded list the moment the heart was pressed, on the argument that the
  /// press needed a visible result.

  /// **It does not any more: the game must not jump to the top.** The filled
  /// heart is the visible result, and it is on the row the user is looking at.

  /// was resolved: hold the cursor on its slot and the user is suddenly on a
  /// different game, follow the game to the top and the whole list flies past
  /// under a press that was meant to mark one row. Either way a mark turned
  /// into navigation, and marking a run of favourites meant re-finding your
  /// place after every one.
  ///
  /// So the row is rewritten in place and nothing moves. The order is still
  /// favourites-first the next time the system opens, which is when that order
  /// is worth something.

  /// The update lands on [_allGames], not on the visible list, because in
  /// subfolder view the visible list is *derived* from it — writing to the
  /// derived copy would be undone by the next rebuild, and the flag itself
  /// would be lost with it. Both are published as new lists rather than
