/// [SqliteService.saveUserConfig] used to mirror a `gameViewMode` write onto
/// `system_view_mode` as well — a leftover from before the two were separate
/// columns. The columns do not share a value domain: the games view also
/// accepts `list`, which nothing on the systems side recognises, so writing
/// the games view mode on its own silently dropped the systems view back to
/// the grid with no option showing as selected.
///
/// Every production write currently names both modes, and the systems one is
/// applied second, so the mapping was masked. These tests write the game mode
/// alone, which is the only shape that shows it.
